Hello! Welcome to the Joke Machine! Created by me, Bo Hauptly!

Inside this file is the Joke Machine, a simple one page app that will allow you to see and rate a number of "bad" jokes that I have put together.

To Use:
As the page loads in, a list of jokes to select will be presented on the side of screen. However, to make things easy to start, the first joke will already be selected for you! You will be able to read the setup and then press the button to have the punchline be delivered directly to you below the setup. Then you may rate the joke 1-10.
If you get bored of the five jokes given to you, you may click the "Roll for more Jokes!" button to receive 5 more jokes!
